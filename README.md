I have kept the tasks completed in the internship in Data Science offered by Oasis Infobyte

It was definitely a privilege for me to be able to do an internship in Oasis Infobyte. I was able to test the skills I have learnt by applying them on practical projects. The internship program was structured and designed to be easily comprehended by everyone. I opted for the Data Science Internship program. There were 5 tasks in it. Each of the tasks were so well designed, as all of those 5 tasks represented the skills needed for every Data science aspirant. So it was amazing and interesting to complete those projects. I am so glad that I had this opportunity. I came to know about this opportunity from Linkedin. It is good to see how vast people are connected in the network of Oasis Infobyte encouraging everyone to do things productive like these.

Tasks given :

IRIS flower prediction
Employment Analysis in India
Car price prediction
Email Spam Detection
Sales Prediction
IRIS flower prediction :

This project is very important for beginners to know how exactly machine learning works. The dimensions of the flowers are given by which we have to classify the flower into it’s families [Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica]. I used Decision Tree Classifier and Gaussian NB to classify. I got an accuracy of 94.7% in each of the models.

Employment Analysis in India:

In this Employment Analysis, I have tried to use various Visualization techniques to analyze and understand the data well. Firstly, I tried to visualize the Unemployment Rate and Labor Participation Rate with respect to each month using a bar plot. And then I also visualize the employee numbers in a bar plot. Then I grouped the data state-wise. Now I did visualize them using a bar plot by each state. Then I used scatter_geo to plot the employment numbers in India Map. It helps us easily visualize how things changed during covid as we have the help of a slider through which we can see the changes in employment on the map as we move the slider.

Car Price Prediction:

In Car price prediction dataset, a lot of features were given. There were a lot of nominal data in the dataset which can’t be fed to the model. So I used a label encoder to encode those features. And then I used a linear regression model to predict the Car price using the features. I got a mean squared error of 9033538.43 in it.

Email Spam detection:

It is necessary for us to be able to classify spam emails inorder to avoid a clumsy inbox. So to train a model that will be able to classify spam emails, The dataset had a lot of messages and each were classified if it is Spam or not. So I used a count vectorizer to encode the messages into a vector. Then I used a Multinomial NB model and trained it on the data. And finally I was able to classify spam emails with the help of the model. When splitting and testing the model, It showed an accuracy of 98.4 %.

Sales Prediction:

The dataset showed how the Sales is respective to the advertisements done in Televisions, Radios and Newspapers. Analysing this will let us be able to train a model that can predict the possible sales considering the Advertisement done on the TV, Radios and Newspapers. First I used a scatter plot to plot each of the advertisement mediums with respect to the sales acheived to get a clear idea on the data. Then I used a Linear regression model to train on the data which gave a mean squared error of Mean Squared Error: 2.12.

Conclusion:

I would like to bestow my heartful thanks to Oasis Infobyte for this wonderful opportunity. I assure you that I will let many people know about this and promote this good community as much as I could. I will always be grateful for this. Wishing you the very best!
